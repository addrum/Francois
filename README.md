This is my very first Android game. It was written using Java and Android’s Surface View. It features multi-threading to handle the graphics and UI elements.

The object of the game is to avoid the weights that fall down randomly from the top of the screen. The longer you survive the more your score increases. Once you hit a rock, game over! The rocks position is determined by Java’s random method between 0 and the screen width which is dynamically fetched so that it is compatible with all Android devices.
